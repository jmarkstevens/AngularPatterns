# AngularPatterns

A collection of simple angular projects providing startup and test examples. Its my angular playground.
I am using webpack 2 and babel for the build tool chain.

I am using JavaScript rather than TypeScript. I also stuck to simple components.
This is something of a React approach to Angular.


**Angular 1.x**

*  Redux SocketIO

**Angular 4.x**

# The basics

Open two terminals at the desired project root. I use iTerm on Mac, ConEmu on Windows 10.
First time do "npm/yarn install". In one terminal "npm run ww".
In the other terminal "npm start".
In your browser localhost:3500. All projects use the same port.
If you want to do it with one terminal session you can run "npm run nw" for no watch.
