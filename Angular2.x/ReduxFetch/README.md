# AngularPatterns Redux Fetch

Just the basics for Angular 2.x, Redux and Fetch. I did some extra work with webpack CommonsChunkPlugin for Angular 2.

# Getting started

cd into the root directory of the project. If the first time "npm install". "npm run ww" for webpack with watch.
"npm run nw" for webpack no watch. "npm start" to start the node server. "localhost:3500" in the browser.
